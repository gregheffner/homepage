                <h1>Secrets: Password Managers and Hardware Keys</h1>
                <h5>Greg Heffner August 18, 2024</h5>

                <img src="/image/blog/2024/Aug/secrets.png" alt="Yubiand1pass"
                    style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 25%; height: auto;">
                        
                        <p>Welcome to 2024 where just having a secure password isnt enough. Remember when a password was secure when a "1 or !"
                            was at the end of your favorite buzz word? I mean who would guess "Password1!?" Whenever I think of password
                            management I think of my mom. She is super smart and has been dealing with PII and HIPPA info her whole life and knows the importance of security. 
                            Immediately I can hear her saying "How can anyone be expected to remember all this?" and she has a point. Memorizing complex passwords is a very hard task. Expound this task to also making sure you dont use
                            the same password twice can feel impossible to most people, myself included. So what I see people do, is sacrifice
                            password security for ease of use. They end up either using less secure passwords that can be easily remembered or
                            very secure passwords but used for multiple accounts. <strong>This is the worse decision someone can make when it comes to
                            password security.</strong> Password managers like 1Password make generating, saving, and sharing passwords super easy. It
                            even has some really cool features I like to use with SSH and WiFi SSID credential storage. </p>
                        
                        <p>Lets say someone has a "safe" password and they also use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) from their favorite
                            provider. Remember 2FA is a second form of identification to verify your identity. <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mvCeNsTa1g">What is 2FA</a> for a brief overview. This is mostly done be sending
                            text messages to a cell phone, or by using an application to view your 2FA code as it is renewed. What I have found
                            is SIM swapping is very prevalent in the wild meaning cloning a phone number and receiving your text messages is
                            easy to an attacker. How can you make sure you are protected? What would you do to immediately stop and revoke the
                            access? YubiKey is a hardware authentication device manufactured by Yubico that supports one-time passwords,
                            public-key cryptography, and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor and FIDO2 protocols developed by the FIDO
                            Alliance. </p>
                            <p>Enhancing your security posture involves implementing secure, isolated, and well-managed passwords alongside a robust
                                2FA solution using a physical encryption key. This approach significantly increases your protection, safeguarding
                                both your identity and devices. My aim is to address the gaps in these critical areas by using 1Password with
                                Yubikey.</p>

                        <h3>1Password</h3>

                            <img src="/image/blog/2024/Aug/1password.png" alt="1password windows"
                                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 45%; height: auto;">
                        
                        <p>There are many password managers out there. I have used a few of them. There are a few reasons why I chose to pay for
                            1Password over other "free" solution that are available. </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Password Security Features-</strong> <a
                                    href="https://support.1password.com/watchtower/?ios#use-watchtower-in-the-1password-apps">Watchtower</a>, <a
                                    href="https://1password.com/password-generator">password generation</a>, used password lists, compromised
                                passwords. Having all of these features in one application makes it very easy to have a strong and safe password. I also like to play the High Score WatchTower game. Whats your score? </li>
                            <li><strong>Secrets Sharing-</strong> <a href="https://support.1password.com/share-items">Securely share 1Password
                                    items with anyone</a> Sync between devices, share vaults with familys, share passwords with people with
                                limits. Think about sharing password with your family when they come over or sharing video stream login details to the kids. I also make separate vaults for personal or work passwords so they dont get mixed. </li>
                            <li><strong>SSH and SSID key management-</strong> <a
                                    href="https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/manage-keys/">create keys, store keys, share keys with
                                    servers</a>. Creating or sharing wifi passwords and SSH keys with people has never been easier.</li>
                        </ol>
                            <p>These features is what brought me to 1Password. As far as I am concerned a password is just that. I needed an
                                application that can help me find passwords that either were compromised or were unsecure. I needed an easy way
                                to send the passwords to people without just texting or writing it down. I wanted something to help alert me
                                when my passwords or email addresses were leaked. Being able to log in to 1Password in the CLI and connect to my
                                secure SSH keys on a new virtual machine is really nice. I have used password sharing countless times and I love the fact you can set limits on how long a person has access
                            and also how many times it can be viewed.</p>

                            <p>Check out the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> website for more information on their features and
                                pricing. Also you can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMl5imFNCQ">video</a> on how to use 1Password for more information.</p>

                            <p>Ive exclusively used Yubikey as my hardware key. Not because of any specific reason, but mainly because the market
                            wasnt very extensive at the time, and Yubikey fulfilled all my requirements. Hardware security keys offer fantastic
                            features, including SSH key support.</p>
                            <ol>

                                <p>I would recommend buying two keys
                                    and setting both up at the same time. This way if you lose one or one gets destroyed you have a backup. Case
                                    in point is as I am writing this article I lost my keys and the dogs found it. They thought it tasted good.
                                    Wild that it still works. Never have had an issue other than this incident. I like that I was able to get both USB-C for my computer and then also NFC for my cell phone
                                so I dont have to carry both devices. Not having cell signal, not relying on power, and not having to depend on someone elses application working is nice.</p>

                                        <li><strong>1Password:</strong> Imagine 1Password as a magical vault where you keep all your secret keys
                                            (like the keys to your tree house or your treasure chest). But instead of physical keys, these are
                                            digital keys—your passwords! 🗝️ Whenever you need to unlock a website or an app, 1Password helps
                                            you remember and use the right password. It’s like having a friendly dragon guarding your secret
                                            codes! 🐉</li>
                                        <li><strong>YubiKey:</strong> Now, YubiKey is like a superhero gadget. It’s a tiny USB stick or a special
                                                key that you plug into your computer. When you’re trying to get into your secret clubhouse
                                                (online accounts), YubiKey swoops in and says, “Hey, I’m here to help!” 🦸‍♂️ It adds an extra
                                                layer of security, like a secret handshake. So even if someone tries to sneak in, YubiKey stops
                                                them! 🛡️</li>
