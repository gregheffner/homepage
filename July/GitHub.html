        <h5>Greg Heffner July 10, 2024</h5>
        <div class="img" style="height: 200px; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
          <img src="/image/blog/2024/July/github.jpg" alt="GitHub Logo" style="width: 35%; height: 200px; object-fit:cover;">
        </div>
        <p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> What a mysterious place. For someone who has never used it before, looking at GitHub might immediately cause
          anxiety. I know this was me at one time. I would look page after page at all the scripts, projects, repositories, and
          package versioning notes as if it was written in another language. I'm not a snake, how can I ever begin to understand
          Python.</p>
        <p>GitHub is like a remote file storage server. You can log into it and retrieve things when you want. You can edit them
          and save them to be retrieved later. You can share items with other people. You can collaborate on projects without
          having to be in person. The difference between GitHub and a file server, though, is that GitHub gives you more control
          over your work.</p>
        <p>Install GitHub here <a href="https://cli.github.com/">GitHub Download Instructions</a></p>
        <p>Understanding five basic commands will get you most of the way to understanding how to use GitHub. I do recommend you
          look through this write-up if you would like more info on the other commands. <a
            href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary#commands">Git Glossary</a></p>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Git init</h3> This initializes a new repository in the location you are currently in. You have to run the git
            init command in a folder in order to connect it to GitHub. This is one of the first commands you run when creating a
            new directory that you want to share; or if you have a file or folder you want to monitor with version control, for
            example.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <h3>Git clone</h3> This command clones a GitHub repository to your local machine. When you are looking at a repo,
            copy the HTTPS link and run git clone and then the address. Example: git clone
            https://github.com/gregheffner/homepage.git After you run this, it will download the files to your machine so you
            can interact with them as you need.
          </li>
          <figure>
            <img src="/image/blog/2024/July/githubclone.jpg" alt="GitHub clone command example"
              style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%; height: auto;">
            <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Top right, you will see the git clone command already typed out for you. You
              just need to copy the text. <a href="https://github.com/gregheffner/homepage">Greg GitHub HomePage</a>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        
          <li>
            <h3>Git add / Git commit</h3> These commands save or commit your work and when you also give the git commit command
            a -m flag, you can put a comment on what you did and why you did it. For example, if you had a text document that
            had your name in it but it was misspelled, you can make the edits in the document. Git add the file with the edits.
            Then add the comment git commit -m "changed name spelling" this will add the note on the commit so you can reference
            edits or changes. You can use these messages to reference ticket numbers if you're fixing something, brief change
            notes, or any text you can put in with a 72 character limit. Just make it easy for anyone to read. You don't want to
            have a note that's unidentifiable to someone who may need to know what has changed without having to dig into the
            code too much.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <h3>Git push</h3> This is how you upload the code or changes you made to code to GitHub. If you make changes on a
            file and don't push them, then only you can see those changes and there is no collaborating on scripts unless the
            other person has local access to the files.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <h3>Git pull</h3> This will download any changes to code you have already cloned. If you make changes to a file on
            one computer and push them to GitHub, you have to git pull those changes on the other computers to get the latest
            updates. GitHub will not pull the latest update on its own. This keeps the code or project you are working on in the
            exact same state as you left it until you pull the updates. Be careful though, don't make any changes to files that
            are not up to date with the latest GitHub version of the files or you will have problems pushing your changes in the
            future.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Understanding these five commands will give you a basic understanding of GitHub. Having a place to store your
          projects, codes, or scripts other than on your local computer is always a good thing. Yes, people have backups and
          USBs and search engines, but this does not help you when you need to work on something on a new computer or on a
          replacement device when you're in a pinch. I highly recommend someone who is new to GitHub to create an account and
          upload a file with "Hello World" written in it. I learn best by doing and repeating. I'm very hands-on. Once you are
          comfortable, clone someone else's repository to test. You don't even have to run the code; you can delete it after.
          Just get your feet wet. It's nice in here.</p>

        <h3>AI response</h3>
        <p>I received a lot of feedback on my last article saying how much people liked the <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing
            AI</a> story about Pi-Hole. So here's another one from Bing AI. Thanks everyone for reading. Feel free to send me
          suggestions by using the contact link at the top.</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <p>GitHub is like a special place where programmers and software developers share their secret codes. Imagine it as a
            magical treehouse where they hang out?</p>
          <p>Here's how it works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Code Storage: GitHub is where they keep their code safe. It's like a treasure chest for their computer
              spells (code).</li>
            <li>Collaboration: They invite their friends (other developers) to play in the treehouse. Together, they build
              cool projects, like building a dragon-catching net or creating a rainbow potion.</li>
            <li>History Book: GitHub remembers every change they make. If they accidentally turn a frog into a pumpkin, they
              can go back to the old frog version.</li>
            <li>Show and Tell: They proudly show off their magical spells (code) to others. It's like saying, “Look, I made
              this flying broomstick!”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So, GitHub is where wizards (developers) share their spells, learn from each other, and create amazing things!</p>
